			<h2 class='header scroller'>the pitch</h3>
				<p id='bodytext'> When extreme skiers Molly Baker and Zack Giffin set out to pitch their idea for a ski tour to their sponsor, Outdoor Research, Tumbleweed’s Epu provided the inspiration to bring people something that no one had ever seen before. Armed with Zack’s background in carpentry, a love for skiing, Zack and Molly created a tiny home with everything their team of FIVE athletes and cameramen would need. What followed became an epic adventure, and a public reaction, to the tiny home on wheels that was something nobody expected.

				<p id='hiddenbodytxt'> Legally, your trailer can only be 8’6’’ wide. The majority of states will also only allow a tiny house that is 13’6 inches off the ground, though some Western states permit 14’. No trailer can exceed 53’, unless you have a special permit.

			<h2 class='header scroller'>putting down roots</h2>
				<p id='bodytext1'>Zack explained that when they came in to Silverton, CO, they had multiple invitations for places to park their tiny home. “The whole community, they just got it and loved it.” The crew would go out for a day of skiing and were amazed to come back and find gifts and firewood left on their doorstep.  “We take it in to the community and it’s like a magnet. The kids understand it. The grandparents understand it.” Molly tells us, “Bring a tiny house in to the community and people are almost automatically your friends. They feel like they are part of something.” 
				</p>
				<p id='hiddenbodytxt1'> Unless people offer help for free, do all of your own work, unless you don’t feel comfortable with it. Labor is incredibly expensive, and the majority of a tiny house build is actually fairly simple. You can learn to do anything after watching enough Youtube videos. The two biggest things that you may want to get help with if you are not comfortable doing the work yourself are the electrical set up and the plumbing set up.

				<h2 class='header scroller'>Challenging norms</h2>
				<p id='bodytext2'>When challenging norms, not everyone is going to agree. Zack says that, although people’s reactions were overwhelmingly positive, there were a few exceptions. “People either get it or they don’t, and they don’t understand why. We show up and we have a completely different mentality. [To those people] we are an affront to their values.” Molly tells us of a police officer who came upon their house parked along a street. “I don’t know what is wrong with this, but something is.” She tried to explain that it was like a cabin on wheels but he just couldn't get it. A few people thought it was Santa’s workshop and, a few others, a coffee cart. "It was so surprising to see people's reactions. Their imaginations of what we we're doing exceeded what we expected."

				<p id='hiddenbodytxt2'> Place windows carefully to minimize glare and maximize views and pleasant light. For example, windows near side walls brighten those walls and generate less contrast and glare than windows placed in the center of a room.

		<h3 class='pull-quote scroller'>The best thing about winter in the tiny house is that we never have a commute. Molly and I wake up at a trailhead or lift. We walk out the front door to go skiing. Although the house has the luxuries of a home, it's kind of like camping.

				<h2 class='header scroller'>they built a house</h2>
				<p id='bodytext3'>Once given the go ahead, Zack and Molly had seven weeks to build the house and plan the tour. The work and the hours put in by both were daunting, but Molly tells us "We were certainly dreaming big, but it's amazing what you can create with grand ideas and purposeful intentions." To make matters more interesting a tree fell on the house in the early part of the build and a freak cold snap filled the home with snow. Molly faced the challenge of trying to explain how they were traveling when calling to ask permission to stay in parking lots. If they didn't understand she’d ask, “Have you heard of Tumbleweed?” and direct them to the website. “Then you drop the tiny house on them!” Looking back she says “Every time we pulled in I sensed that we had exceeded expectations.”
				</p>
				<p id='hiddenbodytxt3'> When asked about their favorite moments with their tiny home, Molly laughs and recalls the first time she saw the house pulled on to the street. “From the back you can’t see the truck so you just see this house going down the street. I was crying I was laughing so hard.”

			<h2 class='header scroller'>the life of a skier</h2>
				<p id='bodytext4'>The interior of the home was customized to meet the needs of the team of five skiers and cameramen as well as all of their gear. Two ropes connected by wooden dowels swung down between the ceiling and the wall above the wood stove to separate the gear, and dry it after a day in the snow.Given the drying clothes and the occupation of the small house by five adults engaged in vigorous physical activity, it is surprising that people’s first reaction upon entering this tiny space was often “Oh my God! It smells amazing in here!” Zack credits three things for the unexpected reaction –
<br>The idea of using raw wood came from looking at Tumbleweed’s website. Zack remembers the scent in the tiny house giving one 
“warm feelings, feelings, like home.”
				</p>
				<p id='hiddenbodytxt4'> One of the things I like about Zack and his tiny house lifestyle is how it so effectively enlarges the ski bum stereotype of skiing all winter and building houses all summer. I’m also totally enamored with the idea of tiny ski houses instead of gigantic ski homes. So I asked Zack if he sees a place for tiny house living at major ski resorts.
