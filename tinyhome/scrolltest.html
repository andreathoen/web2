		<h2>The Story</h2>
		<div class='text-block'>
		<p>What are tiny houses? The tiny house movement? Tiny living?
Simply put, it is a social movement where people are choosing to downsize the space they live in. The typical American home is around 2,600 square feet, whereas the typical small or tiny house is between 100 and 400 square feet. Tiny houses come in all shapes, sizes, and forms, but they enable simpler living in a smaller, more efficient space.
People are joining this movement for many reasons, but the most popular reasons include environmental concerns, financial concerns, and the desire for more time and freedom. For most Americans 1/3 to 1/2 of their income is dedicated to the roof over their heads; this translates to 15 years of working over your lifetime just to pay for it, and because of it 76% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
So what is the alternative? One solution might be to live smaller. While we don’t think tiny houses are for everyone, there are lessons to be learned and applied in order to escape the cycle of debt in which almost 70% of Americans are trapped.

				<h2>The Simple Life</h2>
				<h3>BY LEO BABAUTA</h3>
				<div class='text-block'>
				<p>Decluttering your home and work space can lead to a less cluttered mind. These visual distractions pull on us in more ways than we realize.
		A quiet unrushed morning is a thing to treasure. I wake early so that I have some quiet time to read, write, meditate.
		You can’t have a simple life if you’re unwilling to let go of what you’re used to.
		Letting go can be difficult, but is easier if you do a one-month challenge. Let go of something for a month and see whether you like it or not.
		Letting go of cable TV was one of the best things we did early on — no more constant television in my home, no more ads for crappy things we don’t need.
		Shopping isn’t therapy. It’s a waste of time and money.
		If you’re filling your life with distractions, its probably because you’re afraid of what life would be like without constant Internet, social media, news, TV, games, snacks.
		Simple, whole, healthy food is not only much healthier than junk food: it’s a pleasure.
		You have to make time for what’s important: time with your kids, time with your spouse, time for creating, time for exercise. Push everything else aside to make time.
		Overcommitting is the biggest sin against simple living most people make. I painfully cut out a huge number of commitments to simplify my life, and I’m glad I did. I do this every year or so because I keep forgetting.
		I keep my days mostly unstructured and unscheduled so that I have room for the little things that are so important: reading with my child, going for a walk, taking a nap.
		I have certain activities I do almost every day, though not on a schedule: writing, reading, eating healthy meals, doing a workout or playing with the kids outdoors, processing my email inbox, reading with the kids.
		It’s easy to fill up our lives because there are so many things that sound amazing. We hear about what others are doing and instantly want to add that to our lives. But it’s harder to remember that by adding so many things to our lives, we are subtracting space. And that space is important.
		If you can’t learn to sit in a quiet room alone with no distractions, you won’t be able to simplify.
		Buying things doesn’t solve our problems. Neither does food.
		It’s not how few things we own that matters. It’s whether we make those things count.
		It’s better to have six books on your shelf that you’re really going to read than a hundred you never get around to.
		When you travel lightly, you’re freer, less burdened, less tired. This applies to life, not just travel.
		Your attention is your most valuable possession. Give it as a gift to the people you love most, not a bunch of clowns on the Internet. Give it to the work that matters most, not distractions.
		Sometimes distractions are nice.</p>
