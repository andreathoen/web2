			<div class='text-block scroller'>
			<p> Few names are as closely associated with small living as Jay Shafer, the man who practically invented what is now known as the tiny house. Tiny houses have become a minimalist design and lifestyle ideal. Their tiny size permits no extraneous stuff. They occupy a fraction of the spatial and carbon footprint of a normal home. They are usually owned outright, sidestepping expensive mortgages and financial institutions. And by virtue of their trailer mounting, they can often avoid traditional building regulations.

		<div class='text-block-1 scroller'>
			<p>He built his first tiny house in Iowa, in 1999, and lived in it for five years. It was a hundred and ten square feet, with a steep gabled roof and a porch. It looked like a Gothic cottage from a children’s story. Designing the footprint of a tiny house is simple, since it follows the contour of the trailer. The complicated part is preserving space. What makes Shafer’s houses different from others is the classical elements of form and proportion and the graceful compression of his design. More than tiny, his houses feel sleek.</p>

		<p> Ever since the millinial, the tiny house movement has grown substantially. be it the the global warming crisis and push to move off the grid or the human race craving a simplistic lifestyle in the era of the iphone. Whatever it is there is a portion of the tiny home dwellers that are inherently restless and live tiny so that they can fulfill big adventures and live at home on the road. Take professional skiiers Molly Baker and Zack Giffin who built a tiny home for the road in search for the best powder

		<h3 class='pull-quote scroller'>The best thing about winter in the tiny house is that we never have a commute. Molly and I wake up at a trailhead or lift. We walk out the front door to go skiing. Although the house has the luxuries of a home, it's kind of like camping.</h3>
